# Sprint Naming App

ToDo
-Instances for each sprint, add ability to add different names

-Ability for voting
-Popup messages for announcing winner
-User state, votes, potentially comments

-Look into adding gifs
-Look into emojis
-Slack integration

-Suggestion for IAPs. Potentially a free version and a paid version with functionality locked behind it (e.g. gifs)
